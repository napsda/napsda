# Self-Service Automation
This demo incorporates a number of technologies including VMWare vCenter, AWS, the ServiceNow ITSM, and Ansible Automation Platform. Customers should be familiar with some or all of them.

The demo consists of the following:

1. Self-Service catalog with dynamic forms (price estimate, field validation)
1. Catalog item to order a VM in specified on-premise datacenter
1. Catalog item to order a VM in AWS
1. Request updated as progress occurs
1. Inventory management through SNOW
1. Traceability through SNOW CMDB

## Takeaways

1. Scalable IT self-service
1. SNOW is the business logic center. It integrates processes and provides process orchestration and transparency
1. Ansible is the **`glue`** that ties in IT systems (servers, applications...etc)
1. Ansible reports back to SNOW as systems are updated
